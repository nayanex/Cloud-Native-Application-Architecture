## Lesson Outline

This lesson is all about **reliability metrics**. In order to observe performance, we first need to get clear on how we are defining and measuring it, and that's what we'll cover here.

* **Defining performance**. The first thing we need to do is define what we mean by site reliability or performance. We will talk about performance in terms of providing a certain level of service, and we'll go over what are called the four golden signals that are used in site reliability modeling.
* **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)**. We also need a clear objective or goal, and this is where Service-Level Objectives (or SLOs) come in. We will talk about what SLOs are and what factors to consider when setting them.
* **Service-level indicators (SLIs)**. Once we have a clear definition and objective for the level of performance we want to deliver, we need to consider how we will actually measure this performance. This is done using Service-Level Indicators or SLIs.
* **Error Budgets**. Since we cannot guarantee 100% performance, we need to plan for errors. For example, if we are OK with 99% reliability on a metric, that means we have an error budget of 1%. We are deciding that if things get any worse than that 1%, this is a signal to us that an improvement is needed.
* **Building SLAs**. Finally, we will bring this all together and examine Service-Level Agreements or SLAs. While you personally wonâ€™t have to worry about SLAs as an SRE, it is important to understand the context of SLAs as it does play a part in the overall SRE model.
